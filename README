# lionfs (Link Over Network File System)

	What is it?

Use something like `ln -s http://website/file.ext local_file` and you will have
a local file that points to a network file. It is the purpose.

	How it works?

Basically we do the background when you call the `read()` operation in a symlink
created by lionfs and fill the data with the content received over a http
request to the host. We don't have cache.

	How do I install it?

First you will need `libfuse` library, which probably is already present in your
system.

NOTE: Currently we aren't using `make` because I don't known how to implement it
and I'm with RSI (pt-br LER), typing with only one hand.

Later you simply type `./compile-all.sh` in source directory and if all goes
right a binary called `lionfs` will be created. See next!

	How do I use it?

You will not execute the binary directly, instead you will execute a script
called `lion-mount.sh` which is found in the source directory too. Use
`lion-mount.sh --help` for more details.

NOTE: At the moment we don't have an install script and then you need to execute
the program in the source directory. Modules are default searched in
`./modules/` or `<ld_library_paths>/lionfs/modules/` directories.

	Supported protocols:

Only HTTP

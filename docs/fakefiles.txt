	fakefiles is the way in which lionfs identify each symbolic link
	in directory.

Maybe the most simple implementation possible is what we've used.

Think a lionfs file (or a symbolic link). The symlink needs to contain
some information like URL and size which makes its identification possible.
These informations are stored in our array and to reach it, given a path,
we need to know the target of the symbolic link.
As many people could find obvious to put URL as target of the symlink it
doesn't work because the slash '/' defines a directory and any program who
tries to request target for lionfs will not get satisfied because system
treat each slash as a directory (for example: http://a.com/a is parsed as
directory"http:" directory"a.com" file"a").

The solution was add fake files (fakefiles) as targets of symbolic links
and when some program make requests to lionfs we know how to search by
the file.

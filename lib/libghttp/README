libghttp 1.0.9
gnome-http -- GNOME http client library

READ!!!

The source code of this library was not modified! We only get these files from
the original package
<http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/libghttp/1.0/libghttp-1.0.9.tar.gz> and
remove what we didn't need. However we have changed the line 25 of ghttp.h only 
to allow the program works without libghttp installed on computer (<> -> "").

COPYING is a symbolic link, but it is equal the original COPYING file.

The original README had just the 2nd line of this file and a line like that:
"Read this.", nothing more.
